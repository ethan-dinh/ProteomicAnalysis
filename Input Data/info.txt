	|	|_ Soma plus MGH normalized measures.csv – (File Path: ?)
	|	|	* Every sample was normalized to T1 – TX/T1
	|	|	* Did not remove T1 from the dataset

	|	|_ Soma plus MGH repeat meaures meta.csv – (File Path: ?)
	|		* Meta file for the dataset – Required for time point analysis
	|		* Missing remaining 6 sample analyses from SOMA Logic

	|	|_ Soma plus MGH normalized measures (NO T1).csv
	|	|	* Same as normalized data but T1 is recusively removed
	|	|
	|	|_ Soma plus MGH repeat measures meta (NO T1).csv
	|		* Removed T1 from the meta data to avoid errors with MetaboAnalyst
